# An Object Oriented Approach to working with Dynamo

Source: `https://github.com/onmiddleground/dynamo-core`

This module is a work in process. The intention for this module is to allow developers to more easily write Dynamo 
queries based on an Object Oriented approach.

This documentation will be updated soon along with a video demonstrating how you can make use of the library to 
hopefully assist your experience with single table design and Dynamo queries.

Refer to the test folder in github to see examples on how this library is used.  Please note it's only in Beta and more
work is planned on this module as time permits.

More to come, hang tight but please let me know if you have interest in this.
